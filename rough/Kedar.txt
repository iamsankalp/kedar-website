**About**

Kedar Nimkar - Designer
I care about: Function & form, music & poetry, people & honesty, Design & simplicity; few of my realisations as a designer.

For last 6 years I am building India’s best travel app and website; Cleartrip. Before that, I worked in a boutique product agency called PaperPlane. I also acquired sufficient knowledge in media & online advertising after working at Webchutney for 3 years.

While I am not designing (which hardly happens), I invest my time learning flute, magic & football. I read, write and spend a lot of time with Kiddo (my Dog). I am active on Twitter & Medium but just exist on Instagram and Facebook (for patterns & design).
